    "projectDescription": "The Johnson's own land which he uses for spring grazing for his cattle. Much of this land is good spring grazing, but some of it was old crop land that had not been planted into Crested wheat and has since been taken over by Cheatgrass. He would like to eliminate the Cheatgrass on 150 acres of these pastures by applying Plateau at a rate of 6 oz per acre in the fall of 2009. A light rate of Plateau should be successful because in the fall of 2006 Steward tried to get rid of the Cheatgrass by disking it up. Although the Cheatgrass came back all of the thatch and other cover were removed and the herbicide should be able to cover all the remaining plants. Following the applying of Plateau the Johnson's will drill in a forage mix of Crested Wheat, Intermediate Wheat, and surface apply forge Kochia.",
